(I Have no Idea what I'm doing)
<h1>BIG NOTE (READ THIS SERIOUSLY)</h1>
<p><i>There are four sets included in this project</i></p>
<h4>Main and Final File</h4>
<p><b>[Project 1.4 (Reconfigured)]</b>, same as 1.4 except the code where you can't access files when not logged-in actually works</p>
<h4>These are the extras and previous builds</h4>
<p><b>[Project 1.4]</b> is supposed to be the final output</p>
<p><b>[Project 1.3]</b> is the stripped down basic output with only the .txt files</p>
<p><b>[Project 1.2]</b> is the base version of the project, the same as [Project 1.3]</p>

<h2>EXTRAS</h2>
<p>notes inside the code are for David and John Michael to Read</p>
